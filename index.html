      <p>Emergency essentials are good for emergencies, which are situations where
        an emergency is happening, which needs emergency essentials to essentially 
        help the emergency and the people effected by the emergency, which is an example
        of an emergency situation because it has an emergency in it. Emergency is bad
        because they are emergency situations. Which have emergencies in them.

      <h3 style="font-family:'Lucida Cursive', cursive;">What do you need?</h3>
      <p>Emergency essentials include basic things from daily life that you need. It is
        imperative that the vices of greed, vanity, and avarice do not blind you from the
      things you truly need, and to remain pure and detached from material possessions. 
      These things include: Basic Hygiene essentials, important documents that verify your
      identity, money because money is good, and occasionally rations for situations you may
      not have access to food.
